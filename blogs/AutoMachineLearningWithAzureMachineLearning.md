## Auto Machine Learning with Azure Machine Learning

I recently wrote a blog introducing automated machine learning (AutoML). If you have not read it you can check it out [here](https://github.com/ryanchynoweth44/AutoMLExamples/blogs/AutoMachineLearning.md). With there being a surplus of AutoML libraries in the marketplace my goal is to provide quick overviews and demo of libraries that I use to develop solutions. In this blog I will focus on the benefits of the Azure Machine Learning Service (AML Service) and the AutoML capabilities it provides. The AutoML library of Azure machine learning is different (not unique) from many other libraries because it also provides a platform to track, train, and deploy your machine learning models.     

### Azure Machine Learning Service
An Azure Machine Learning Workspace (AML Workspace) is the foundation of developing python-based predictive solutions, and gives the developer the ability to deploy it as a web service in Azure. The AML Workspace allows data scientists to track their experiments, train and retrain their machine learning models, and deploy machine learning solutions as a containerized web service. When an engineer provisions an Azure Machine Learning Workspace the resources below are also created within the same resource group, and are the backbone to Azure Machine Learning. 

- Azure Container Registry
- Azure Storage 
- Azure Application Insights
- Azure Key Vault

The Azure Container Registry gives a developer easy integration with creating, storing, and deploying our web services as Docker containers. One added feature is the easy and automatic tagging to describe your container and associate the container with specific machine learning models.  

An Azure Storage account enables for fast dynamic storing of information from our experiments i.e. models, outputs. After training an initial model using the service, I would recommend manually navigating through the folders. Doing this will give you deeper insight into how the AML Workspace functions. But simply and automatically capture metadata and outputs from our training procedures is crucial to visibility and performance over time.  

When we deploy a web service using the AML Service, we allow the Azure Machine Learning resource to handle all authentication and key generation code. This allows data scientists to focus on developing models instead of writing authentication code. Using Azure Key Vault, the AML Service allows for extremely secure web services that you can expose to external and internal customers.  

Once your secure web service is deployed. Azure Machine Learning integrates seamlessly with Application Insights for all code logging and web service traffic giving users the ability to monitor the health of the deployed solution. 

A key feature to allowing data scientists to scale their solutions is offering remote compute targets. Remote compute gives developers the ability easily get their solution off their laptop and into Azure with a familiar IDE and workflow. The remote targets allow developers to only pay for the run time of the experiment, making it a low cost for entry in the cloud analytics space. Additionally, there was a service in Azure called Batch AI that was a queuing resource to handle several jobs at one time. Batch AI was integrated into Azure Machine Learning allowing data scientists to train many machine learning models in parallel with separate compute resources.    

Azure Machine Learning provides data prep capabilities in the form of a "dprep" file allowing users to package up their data transforms into a single line of code. I am not a huge fan of the dprep but it is a capability that makes it easier to handle the required data transformations to score new data in production. Like most platforms, the AML Service offers specialized "pipeline" capabilities to connect various machine learning phases with each other like data acquisition, data preparation, and model training.   

In addition to remote compute, Azure Machine Learning enables users to deploy anywhere they can run docker. Theoretically, one could train a model locally and deploy a model locally (or another cloud), and only simply use Azure to track their experiments for a cheap monthly rate. However, I would suggest taking advantage of Azure Kubernetes Service for auto scaling of your web service to handle the up ticks in traffic, or to a more consistent compute target in Azure Container Instance. 

### Using Azure Machine Learning's AutoML

Now itâ€™s time to get to the actual point of this blog. Azure Machine Learning's AutoML capabilities. In order to use Azure Machine Learning's AutoML capabilities you will need to pip install `azureml-sdk`. This is the same Python library used to simply track your experiments in the cloud.  

As with any data science project, it starts with data acquisition and exploration. In this phase of developing we are exploring our dataset and identifying desired feature columns to use to make predictions. Our goal here is to create a machine learning dataset to predict our label column. 

Once we have created our machine learning dataset and identified if we going to implement a classification or a regression solution, we can let Azure Machine Learning do the rest of the work to identify the best feature column combination, algorithm, and hyper-parameters. 

To automatically train a machine learning model using Azure ML the developer will need to: define the settings for the experiment then submit the experiment for model tuning. Once submitted, the library will iterate through different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter settings, following your defined constraints. It chooses the best-fit model by optimizing an accuracy metric. The parameters or setting available to auto train machine learning models are:   

- **iteration_timeout_minutes**: time limit for each iteration. `Total runtime = iterations * iteration_timeout_minutes`
- **iterations**: Number of iterations. Each iteration produces a machine learning model.  
- **primary_metric**: metric to optimize. We will choose the best model based on this value.  
- **preprocess**: When `True` the experiment may auto preprocess the input data with basic data manipulations.  
- **verbosity**: Logging level. 
- **n_cross_validations**: Number of cross validation splits when the validation data is not specified.

The output of this process is a dataset containing the metadata on training runs and their results. This dataset enables developers to easily choose the best model based off the metrics provided. The ability to choose the best model out of many training iterations with different algorithms and feature columns automatically enables us to easily automate the model selection process for *each* model deployment. With typical machine learning deployments, engineers typically deploy the same algorithm with the same feature columns each time, and the only difference was the dataset the model was trained on. But with Auto Machine Learning solutions we are able to note only choose the best algorithm, feature combination, and hyper-parameters each time. That means, we can deploy a decision tree model trained on 4 columns one release, the deploy a logistic regression model trained on 5 columns another release without any code edits. 

### My one compliant

My one compliant is installing the library is difficult. The documentation states that it works with Python 3.5.2 and up, however, I was unable to get the proper libraries installed and working correctly using a Python 3.6 interpreter. I simply created a Python 3.5.6 interpreter and it worked great! Not sure if this was an error on my part or Microsoft's but the AutoML capabilities worked as expected otherwise.   

Overall, I think Azure Machine Learning' Auto ML works great. It is not ground breaking or a game changer, but it does exactly as advertised which is huge in the current landscape of data where it seems as if many tools do not work as expected. Azure ML will run iterations over your dataset to figure out the best model possible, but in the end predictive solutions depend on the correlation between your data points. For a more detailed example of Azure Machine Learning's AutoML feature check out my walk through available [here](https://github.com/ryanchynoweth44/AutoMLExamples/AzureMLExample/walkthrough/01_EnvironmentSetup.md).
