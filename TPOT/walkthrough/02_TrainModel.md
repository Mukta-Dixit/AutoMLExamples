## Training a Machine Learning Model with AureML's AutoML

In this section of the walk through we will be using our cloud resources to track and train a model locally using the AutoML library of Azure Machine Learning. Please note that Azure Machine Learning does provide remote compute targets to scale the training process and will be covered later in the walk through. 

The dataset that we are using is the popular titanic dataset where we use information about each passenger to predict whether or not they survived the catastrophe. For more information about the dataset check out the [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
